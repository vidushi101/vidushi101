Hi, I’m @vidushi101
I’m working as a technical solutions analyst at Oracle Cerner (India)and would be beginning my postgraduate program in health informatics soon.
I am interested in all things Digital, Data driven, and requiring a deep dive into analysis, especially for the healthcare sector.
I have a decent grasp on SQL, R and  tableau, and I am currently working on my Python and Power BI skills.
I’m looking forward to collaborate on SQL/R/Tableau based projects.
